# Pompompurin Café – Nostalgic HTML/CSS Project

This project is a **fictitious website exercise** made with **HTML & CSS** to practice the basics of web development.  
I took inspiration from the **Pompompurin Café** (Sanrio’s adorable character) and recreated a nostalgic vibe, similar to the early 2010s blog style.
